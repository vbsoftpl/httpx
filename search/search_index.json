The http3 library is designed to be API compatible with requests wherever possible. First start by importing HTTP3: >>> import http3 Now, let\u2019s try to get a webpage. >>> r = http3 . get ( 'https://httpbin.org/get' ) >>> r < Response [ 200 OK ] > Similarly, to make an HTTP POST request: >>> r = http3 . post ( 'https://httpbin.org/post' , data = { 'key' : 'value' }) The PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests all follow the same style: >>> r = http3 . put ( 'https://httpbin.org/put' , data = { 'key' : 'value' }) >>> r = http3 . delete ( 'https://httpbin.org/delete' ) >>> r = http3 . head ( 'https://httpbin.org/get' ) >>> r = http3 . options ( 'https://httpbin.org/get' ) Passing Parameters in URLs To include URL query parameters in the request, use the params keyword: >>> params = { 'key1' : 'value1' , 'key2' : 'value2' } >>> r = http3 . get ( 'https://httpbin.org/get' , params = params ) To see how the values get encoding into the URL string, we can inspect the resulting URL that was used to make the request: >>> r . url URL ( 'https://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1' ) You can also pass a list of items as a value: >>> params = { 'key1' : 'value1' , 'key2' : [ 'value2' , 'value3' ]} >>> r = http3 . get ( 'https://httpbin.org/get' , params = params ) >>> r . url URL ( 'https://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2&key2=value3' ) Response Content HTTP3 will automatically handle decoding the response content into unicode text. >>> r = http3 . get ( 'https://www.example.org/' ) >>> r . text '<!doctype html> \\n <html> \\n <head> \\n <title>Example Domain</title>...' You can inspect what encoding has been used to decode the response. >>> r . encoding 'UTF-8' If you need to override the standard behavior and explicitly set the encoding to use, then you can do that too. >>> r . encoding = 'ISO-8859-1' Binary Response Content The response content can also be accessed as bytes, for non-text responses: >>> r . content b '<!doctype html> \\n <html> \\n <head> \\n <title>Example Domain</title>...' Any gzip and deflate HTTP response encodings will automatically be decoded for you. If brotlipy is installed, then the brotli response encoding will also be supported. For example, to create an image from binary data returned by a request, you can use the following code: >>> from PIL import Image >>> from io import BytesIO >>> i = Image . open ( BytesIO ( r . content )) JSON Response Content Often Web API responses will be encoded as JSON. >>> r = http3 . get ( 'https://api.github.com/events' ) >>> r . json () [{ u 'repository' : { u 'open_issues' : 0 , u 'url' : 'https://github.com/...' ... }}] Custom Headers To include additional headers in the outgoing request, use the headers keyword argument: >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/headers' >>> headers = { 'user-agent' : 'my-app/0.0.1' } >>> r = http3 . get ( url , headers = headers ) Sending Form Encoded Data Some types of HTTP requests, such as POST and PUT requests, can include data in the request body. One common way of including that is as form encoded data, which is used for HTML forms. >>> data = { 'key1' : 'value1' , 'key2' : 'value2' } >>> r = http3 . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , data = data ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"form\" : { \"key2\" : \"value2\" , \"key1\" : \"value1\" }, ... } Form encoded data can also include multiple values form a given key. >>> data = { 'key1' : [ 'value1' , 'value2' ]} >>> r = http3 . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , data = data ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"form\" : { \"key1\" : [ \"value1\" , \"value2\" ] }, ... } Sending Multipart File Uploads You can also upload files, using HTTP multipart encoding: >>> files = { 'upload-file' : open ( 'report.xls' , 'rb' )} >>> r = http3 . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , files = files ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"files\" : { \"upload-file\" : \"<... binary content ...>\" }, ... } You can also explicitly set the filename and content type, by using a tuple of items for the file value: >>> files = { 'upload-file' : ( 'report.xls' , open ( 'report.xls' , 'rb' ), 'application/vnd.ms-excel' )} >>> r = http3 . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , files = files ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"files\" : { \"upload-file\" : \"<... binary content ...>\" }, ... } Sending JSON Encoded Data Form encoded data is okay if all you need is simple key-value data structure. For more complicated data structures you'll often want to use JSON encoding instead. >>> data = { 'integer' : 123 , 'boolean' : True , 'list' : [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ]} >>> r = http3 . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , json = data ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"json\" : { \"boolean\" : true , \"integer\" : 123 , \"list\" : [ \"a\" , \"b\" , \"c\" ] }, ... } Sending Binary Request Data For other encodings you should use either a bytes type, or a generator that yields bytes . You'll probably also want to set a custom Content-Type header when uploading binary data. Response Status Codes We can inspect the HTTP status code of the response: >>> r = http3 . get ( 'https://httpbin.org/get' ) >>> r . status_code 200 HTTP3 also includes an easy shortcut for accessing status codes by their text phrase. >>> r . status_code == http3 . codes . OK True We can raise an exception for any Client or Server error responses (4xx or 5xx status codes): >>> not_found = http3 . get ( 'https://httpbin.org/status/404' ) >>> not_found . status_code 404 >>> not_found . raise_for_status () Traceback ( most recent call last ): File \"/Users/tomchristie/GitHub/encode/httpcore/http3/models.py\" , line 776 , in raise_for_status raise HttpError ( message ) http3 . exceptions . HttpError : 404 Not Found Any successful response codes will simply return None rather than raising an exception. >>> r . raise_for_status () Response Headers The response headers are available as a dictionary-like interface. >>> r . headers Headers ({ 'content-encoding' : 'gzip' , 'transfer-encoding' : 'chunked' , 'connection' : 'close' , 'server' : 'nginx/1.0.4' , 'x-runtime' : '148ms' , 'etag' : '\"e1ca502697e5c9317743dc078f67693f\"' , 'content-type' : 'application/json' }) The Headers data type is case-insensitive, so you can use any capitalization. >>> r . headers [ 'Content-Type' ] 'application/json' >>> r . headers . get ( 'content-type' ) 'application/json' Multiple values for a single response header are represented as a single comma separated value, as per RFC 7230 : A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field name into one \u201cfield-name: field-value\u201d pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field value to the combined field value in order, separated by a comma. Cookies Any cookies that are set on the response can be easily accessed: >>> r = http3 . get ( 'http://httpbin.org/cookies/set?chocolate=chip' , allow_redirects = False ) >>> r . cookies [ 'chocolate' ] 'chip' To include cookies in an outgoing request, use the cookies parameter: >>> cookies = { \"peanut\" : \"butter\" } >>> r = http3 . get ( 'http://httpbin.org/cookies' , cookies = cookies ) >>> r . json () { 'cookies' : { 'peanut' : 'butter' }} Cookies are returned in a Cookies instance, which is a dict-like data structure with additional API for accessing cookies by their domain or path. >>> cookies = http3 .

The history property of the response can be used to inspect any followed redirects. It contains a list of all any redirect responses that were followed, in the order in which they were made. For example, GitHub redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS. >>> r = http3 . get ( 'http://github.com/' ) >>> r . url URL ( 'https://github.com/' ) >>> r . status_code 200 >>> r . history [ < Response [ 301 Moved Permanently ] > ] You can modify the default redirection handling with the allow_redirects parameter: >>> r = http3 . get ( 'http://github.com/' , allow_redirects = False ) >>> r . status_code 301 >>> r . history [] If you\u2019re making a HEAD request, you can use this to enable redirection: >>> r = http3 . head ( 'http://github.com/' , allow_redirects = True ) >>> r . url 'https://github.com/' >>> r . history [ < Response [ 301 Moved Permanently ] > ] Timeouts HTTP3 defaults to including reasonable timeouts for all network operations, meaning that if a connection is not properly established then it should always raise an error rather than hanging indefinitely. The default timeout for network inactivity is five seconds.
